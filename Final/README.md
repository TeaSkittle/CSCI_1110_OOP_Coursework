# Final

### Overview

This project is a text ediotr with exrta features and programs built in, similar in comcept to emacs, but this is no emacs and is not meant to be a replacement for one. Simply I have always wanted to create a real text editor, and this is my contribution to the other thousands that are out there. I have already created a simple line-based editor ( influenced by the classic UNIX ed ) which was written in POSIX sh. Yuu can find the repo for that here: [ ted]( https://github.com/TeaSkittle/ted ). So this is my project is my take on writting a GUI editor with more features and that can be actaully useful day to day. Although don't underestimate the power of line-based editors, as most of the UNIX core was written in ed! ( don't belive me, read this: http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html ).

## Ed

A simple text editor written in JavaFX.

### Features

 *Implemented*  
- Dark theme
- Mode line
- Keyboard shortcuts

*Not Yet Implemented*
- Shell like commands in mode line ( will need a whole new class here )

## Calc

This is s stack based calculator designed for programmers which uses Reverse Polish Notation( RPN for short, also called: Postfix notation ). It can do all sorts of calculations, but the syntax is different from what we are normally use to. For example in normal syntax ( Infix ), a simple addition problem looks as such:
```Java
12 + 7 = 17
```
With RPN that is done like this:
```Java
12 7 + = 17
```

It takes some time to get used to but you can do complex calcutaions even without the need to use parenthesis. A good example of its capabilities is converting Celcius to Fahrenheit. Here is an example converting 20°C to 68°F:
```Lisp
Infix:
( 20 × 9/5 ) + 32 = 68

Postfix:
20 9 5 / * 32 + = 68
```

> Worth noting that this calculator handles both integers and floating point numbers.

### Operators

```Java
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
^ Exponents
% Modulo
! Factorial
r Square Root
```
> Factorial and sqyare roots are the odd ones here, the calcutalor expects atlteast two numbers and an operator, so if you only want to the facotial of one number place a 0 before( although this issue is not present if more than 1 number is given ). Here is an example of finding 10 factorial ( square roots work the same way ):

```Java
// Will not work
> 10 !
error

// This works
> 0 10 !
362880.0

// No 0 needed if other values are present
> 2 10 ! *
725760.0
```

### Examples

Here are simple examples showcasing each operator  
```Java
// Addition
> 5 2 +
7

// Subtraction
> 10 2 -
8

// Multiplication
> 3 6 * 
18

//. Division
> 25 5 /
5

// Exponents
> 3 2 ^ 
9

// Modulo
> 10 6 % 
4

// Factorial
> 0 5 ! 
24

// Square Root
> 0 25 r
5
```

### Use in code

To use Calc.java in another project is quite simple, create with simple contructr and either call the REPL for interactive use, or call with String[] argument for a single calcutalation.
```Java
// Create new Calc object
Calc calc = new Calc();

// Create String[] to calculate
String[] tokens = new String[] { "2", "1", "+", "3", "*" };

// Will print out calculation ( "9" in this example )
System.out.println( calc.run( tokens ));

// Call the interactive Read Eval Print Loop ( REPL )
calc.repl();

// To exit the REPL, enter: 
> 0 0 q
```
