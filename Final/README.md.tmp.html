<h1>Final</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This project is a text editor with extra features and programs built in, similar in comcept to emacs, but this is no emacs and is not meant to be a replacement for one. Simply I have always wanted to create a real text editor, and this is my contribution to the other thousands that are out there. I have already created a simple line-based editor ( influenced by the classic UNIX ed ) which was written in POSIX sh. Yuu can find the repo for that here: <a href="https://github.com/TeaSkittle/ted">ted</a>. So this is my project is my take on writting a GUI editor with more features and that can be actaully useful from day-to-day. Inspired by the naming convention used in vim ( and due to the fact this is my second text editor ), I call this editor <strong>tedi</strong>, which is an ancronym for: <strong>T</strong>ravis' <strong>ED</strong>itor <strong>I</strong>mproved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although don't underestimate the power of line-based editors, as most of the UNIX core was written in ed! ( don't belive me, read this: http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html ).</p>

<h3>TODO</h3>

<ul>
<li>Split docs into several Markdown files
<ul>
<li>Maybe try using a GitHub wiki</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Ed</h2>

<p>A simple text editor written in JavaFX.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A HUGE thanks to https://github.com/mwaddo/TextEditor/, without this I would not have been able to figure out how to implement the opening and saving of files.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p><em>Implemented</em> <br />
- Dark theme
- Mode line
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Simple interperter in the bottom TextArea</p>

<p><em>Not Yet Implemented</em>
- Working on Windows, Linux, Mac, &amp; BSD ( need to test )</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p><em>C = Control</em>
- C-x Switch to bottom TexArea and input commands( see <em>Shell</em> section below )
- C-s Save as file
- C-o Open file
- C-f Move cursor forward one character
- C-b Move cursor back one character</p>

<p>I included a simple "Hello World" java program that I wrote in this editor to be a simple proof of concept.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to add more functionality here, but JavaFX is limiting in what it can accomplish with text manipulation. If I want to make a more full fledged editor I would have to use something similar to <a href="https://github.com/FXMisc/RichTextFX">RichTextFX</a>, or avoid JavaFX all together.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Shell</h2>

<p>This is a pretty simple interpreter designed to be used in the bottom TextArea of Ed. Only has a few commands, but can easily add more in the future.</p>

<p><em>Commands:</em>
- print: prints all text after the command( similar to UNIX's echo )
- calc: run a calculation in Calc.java( see section below )
- quit: successfully exit the program</p>

<hr />

<h2>Calc</h2>

<p>This is s stack based calculator designed for programmers which uses Reverse Polish Notation( RPN for short, also called: Postfix notation ). It can do all sorts of calculations, but the syntax is different from what we are normally use to. For example in normal syntax ( Infix ), a simple addition problem looks as such:
<code>Java
12 + 7 = 17
</code>
With RPN that is done like this:
<code>Java
12 7 + = 17
</code></p>

<p>It takes some time to get used to but you can do complex calcutaions even without the need to use parenthesis. A good example of its capabilities is converting Celcius to Fahrenheit. Here is an example converting 20°C to 68°F:
```Lisp
Infix:
( 20 × 9/5 ) + 32 = 68</p>

<p>Postfix:
20 9 5 / * 32 + = 68
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Worth noting that this calculator handles both integers and floating point numbers.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p><code>Java
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
^ Exponents
% Modulo
! Factorial
r Square Root
</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Factorial and sqyare roots are the odd ones here, the calcutalor expects atlteast two numbers and an operator, so if you only want to the facotial of one number place a 0 before( although this issue is not present if more than 1 number is given ). Here is an example of finding 10 factorial ( square roots work the same way ):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>```Java
// Will not work</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 !
error</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// This works</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0 10 !
362880.0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// No 0 needed if other values are present</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 10 ! *
725760.0
```</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are simple examples showcasing each operator <br />
```Java
// Addition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 2 +
7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Subtraction</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 2 -
8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Multiplication</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 6 * 
18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>//. Division</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>25 5 /
5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Exponents</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 2 ^ 
9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Modulo</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 6 % 
4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Factorial</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0 5 ! 
24</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// Square Root</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0 25 r
5
```</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Use in code</h3>

<p>To use Calc.java in another project is quite simple, create with simple contructr and either call the REPL for interactive use, or call with String[] argument for a single calcutalation.
```Java
// Create new Calc object
Calc calc = new Calc();</p>

<p>// Create String[] to calculate
String[] tokens = new String[] { "2", "1", "+", "3", "*" };</p>

<p>// Will print out calculation ( "9" in this example )
System.out.println( calc.run( tokens ));</p>

<p>// Call the interactive Read Eval Print Loop ( REPL )
calc.repl();</p>

<p>// To exit the REPL, enter: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0 0 q
```</p>
